* Changes to the boards.txt file must be done to program the RECEIVERmicro. You can find the boards.txt file in "arduino-1.8.5\hardware\arduino\avr"
* Copy the "optiboot_atmega328_12MHz.hex" file to the folder "arduino-1.8.5\hardware\arduino\avr\bootloaders\optiboot"

After that you have to restart the IDE and then you can choose the new Board "RECEIVERmicro" and burn the bootloader with any AVR-programmer.
